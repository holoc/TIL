# TIL
> Today I Learned

This is a collection of short write-ups about Things I Learned across a 
variety of languages and technologies. I was inspired to start this
repository after reading Simon Wilson's [hacker new post][1], and he was
apparently inspired by Josh Branchaud's [TIL collection][2].
