# GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

While learning how to use Git, I discovered about GitHub Actions as a way to automate my development workflow. There are a few interesting actions that I would like to implement into my workflow down road.

My first use case is this interesting way to keep track of my TILs through GitHub Actions that I had read an article on Simon Wilson's [hacker new post](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/).

Some other GitHub Actions that have potential for future uses:
