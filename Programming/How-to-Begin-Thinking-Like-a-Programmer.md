# How to Begin Thinking Like a Programmer by Andy Harris

Code isn't about language (e.g. what's the best language? how many languages should I learn?). 

Coding has only about ~8 main concepts and they work in almost the same way in every language.
1. new variable - Name, Type, InitVal
2. ouput - message
3. input - variable, message
4. while loop - sentry, initialization code, condition, change code
5. for loop - sentry, start, finish, change
...concepts not covered in the lecture
6. lists and tuples
7. string manipulation
8. working with built-in help
9. list iterations
10. functions - scope, parameters, return
11. objects

Learn how to use these concepts in English then write out the concepts first, then convert to code later.
A beginner programmer should think: Code explains the comments to the computer.

Failure is a normal part of programming. Lots of debugging related to bad algorithms due to not understanding the problem.
